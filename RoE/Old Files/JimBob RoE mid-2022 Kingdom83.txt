Kingdom 83 - Rules of Engagement (RoE)

The RoE is a basic set of rules to follow that creates a fair growing environment for all equally. Those that violate the spirit of the RoE, whether written or unwritten, are in violation of the RoE, and are working against the common good of the Kingdom. Violations will be determined by the Royal Council and punishment is at their discretion.

Like Passwords they must be exactly the same.   RoE is not the same as ROE or roe    ONLY RoE will work!!!

1.1 General rules
-The Kingdom is at peace apart from the Clash Of Thrones event.
-Attacks on players in human-made clans is illegal outside of Clash Of Thrones 
-YOU ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THIS ROE IF YOU ARE CLANLESS,  IN A COMPUTER-GENERATED CLAN OR IN A CLAN WITH LESS THAN 20 MEMBERS.  Soon there will be a requirement to have a capital so build your Clan capital NOW!
-As a Common Courtesy message any Non clan or computer clan cities that you attack telling them that they need to join a real clan to not be attacked. 
-Treat Others with respect in the game and in chat rooms.   There will be no offensive Language and racist language Tolerated. This can earn Punitive City attacks from the royal counsel and even Outlaw status if the behavior persists.

2.1 -OUTLAWS ARE NEVER PROTECTED
-Players found repeatedly violating/abusing the RoE or found to be working with other Kingdoms to bypass the RoE will be subject to Penalty at the discretion of the Royal Council and may be outlawed in this kingdom completely.

All Clans should have “We Follow K83 RoE” on their Clan Page Description!

3.1 Peace Time in the Kingdom
If any attacks happen during peace times in the Kingdom You will be required to pay reasonable compensation to the player you hit. This is the only time players have a chance to rebuild troops in between events so no attacks are allowed during peace time.

CP exchanges are Highly suggested to earn CP (Conquest Points) legally during peace time.   You should forge friendships with members of other clans to organize exchanged attacks to earn CP.   You can also organize Clan VS Clan one day battles.  These are best held during times of Half Price Resurrection that happens during KvK (thirst for battle event)

All clan Leaders will be held responsible for their clan and players to be sure we all play fairly and have a great and powerful kingdom. Do not bully or farm others. It is cheap, and unethical.


4.1 War Times 
-War Time for example: Clash of Thrones and KvK 
-Might requirements for hitting during Cot event is the 50% Might rule.   The defender can not be less than 50% of the might of the attacker.  
-(EXAMPLE: If the Attacker has 2M might then the Defender can not be less that 1M might) 
-Anyone can hit someone above their level if you choose to do so, but there is a 24hr window where attacks can be returned during Clash of Thrones Events by that player in retaliation on a one-to-one basis.  


5.1 Citadels, Monsters and Crypts 
-Citadels, Monsters and Crypts are available to everyone anywhere.  It is the first to go to it gets it.   
-Whether it be in the wild or in any clan's area they are for all to hit. 

6.1 Resources Tiles
-Resource tiles inside a clan area are the exclusive property of the clan and that includes all Dragon Mounds and WellSprings that are in a clan’s area, attempting to seize them is illegal. Any poacher of these clan owned tiles can be attacked and kicked off any said tiles in a clan’s area.
-Resource tiles outside clan areas belong to the first to capture them, once a player has captured it is illegal to remove them and you must have the report with times showing you were the first to land on them if you get hit and are booted off of them.


6.2 -Dragon Mounds and Wellsprings are protected by ROE Rules! If they are occupied by a player no hits are allowed on these DM and WS that are occupied legally!!!!
(If u break these rules u will expected to pay compensation for the hits in silver with no exception) Dragon Mounds(DM) and Wellspring Ruins(WS) outside of clan territories MUST be registered at “K83 Gold” OR “K83 Tar” chat rooms. Players have 15 minutes after registration to claim them. Anyone in a clan can claim a level 5 Dragon Mound, and 1,000,000 might to be claim level 10 Dragon Mounds. You may only register 2 Dragon Mounds per 24 Hour Period.  You can register as many Well Springs as you like a day.
-Wellsprings have no Might limits
-Only players in human-made clans can occupy any DM or WS
The Might Limit speeds the collection of the mounds and increases the number that spawn each day.
A person that is Illegally Occupying DMs and WSs can be removed after you properly register the dragon mound.


7.1 Gold Ingots and Payment of Taxes
-Taxes in the form of gold ingots produced in your city capital must be paid daily to the kingdom.
-Any player who does not pay their taxes and has more than 20k ingots can be hit by a champion appointed by the council to collect them. They are only of use to the Kingdom to turn on bonuses for all players in the kingdom.


8.1 Portals
-Portals inside Clan territory are protected and cannot be attacked or scouted
.-Portals for Events cannot be attacked or scouted unless they are a hostile portal and attacks are coming from them. 
-You may close that portal to protect your clan this includes portal at Doomsday events and other events.






9.1 Clan buildings
-It is forbidden to attack or scout any Clan buildings, capitals or forts.  If you attack or scout any Clan buildings, capitals or forts you will be given outlaw status.  
 



            10.1 All attacks are subject to retaliation. 1 attack=1 retaliation. 
Illegal attacks are subject to retaliation or compensation. Silver is generally used to compensate.	
Try to resolve it between yourself and the attacker first directly. If that fails to resolve the problem within 24 hours, have your clan leader contact the attacker’s clan leader. If that does not work then post the violation in the K83 Violations chat. At that point the counsil is reviewing it for outlaw status and fairness. 


ROE VIOLATIONS — DO NOT APPROACH THE KING DIRECTLY
POSTING ANY ATTACKS IN VIOLATIONS CHAT ROOM BEFORE 24 HOURS VOIDS YOUR CLAIM EXCEPT CLAN BUILDING ATTACKS!
